1. Get Poedit App. http://poedit.net/download

2. Run Poedit. Navigate File>New catalog from POT file. Fill in the basic fields, set your country, language.

3. Translate the strings by clicking on a sentance and filling in the textarea bellow. If strange characters accure like %1$d, just ignore them and make a translation in between including these strange characters.

4. Save your file as prdctfltr-**LANGUAGE**.po **LANGUAGE** represents your language code. For instance if you're translating to Italian your language code is it_IT and the file name should be prdctfltr-it_IT.po ( language codes: de_DE (Germany), fr_FR (France) etc.)

5. Upload the .po and the .mo file generated by Poedit to your Wordpress installation in the /wp-content/languages/plugins/ folder If the folder does not exists create one.

** Note you'll need to set your language in the wp-config.php also. Change the define('WPLANG', ''); to lets say italian define('WPLANG', 'it_IT');

That's it! Enjoy!


*** If you have already translated the file with the previous Product Filter version, copy the .po file in your unzipped local copy of Product Filter in the /lang/ folder (if it doesn't exsist just create one) and rescan the plugin for new and merging strings!
