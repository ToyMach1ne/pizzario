 * Customer Reset Password email
 *
 * This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/woocommerce/emails/customer-reset-password.php.
 *
 * HOWEVER, on occasion WooCommerce will need to update template files and you (the theme developer).
 * will need to copy the new files to your theme to maintain compatibility. We try to do this.
 * as little as possible, but it does happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will.
 * be bumped and the readme will list any important changes.
